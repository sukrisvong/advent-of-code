# Purpose
This is just a place for me to document my progress on advent-of-code 2024. This repository is divided into 2 folders.

## working_code
This is where I save my solutions as they were when I solved the problem (after day7. Before day7 I did a little bit of code cleanup). It is messy and can give insight into how I solve problems.

## clean_code
This is where I take my solutions and refine them in a way that I feel is nice. I'm going for a more subjective approach of code that I'm "proud of" and "feels good to me" as opposed to trying to following any specific guidelines (readability, modularity, etc.). I'm not planning on using a lot of effort to optimize my solution's runtimes, unless I see a cool opportunity to as I'm cleaning the code up
